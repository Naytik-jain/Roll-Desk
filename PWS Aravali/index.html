        <h2>Pathways World School, Aravali</h2>
        <img src="images.jpg">
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p style="">Implementing the ideas laid out by national and international experts, Pathways World School Aravali was the first school to be launched under the Pathways umbrella in the year 2003. The curriculum includes the Primary Years, Middle Years and Diploma Programme of the International Baccalaureate Organisation of Geneva. Pathways Aravali was the first IB Continuum School in North India and the first residential school in the region to follow the IB curriculum. The school applies the Multiple Intelligences approach, developed by Dr. Howard Gardner from Harvard University. The campus is situated in 34 acres of land on an elevated, wooded site along the majestic foothills of the Aravali Hills. This not only ensures a tranquil environment away from the rush and din of city life, but also offers a magnificent scenic panorama across the hills. Despite its unique location, the school is only 35 kilometers from the Delhi International Airport and falls within the NCR.<br>

            The school offers both day and boarding options for students while providing flexibility in the boarding options with choices among week, fortnight and term boarding. The current student strength of the school is approximately 1400 with representation from over 40 nations. The school has been consistently ranked among the top international schools in the country. In the latest Education World Rankings for International Day cum Residential Schools, Pathways Aravali was ranked 1 in the whole of North India and ranked 2 in India. The school was also the recipient of the ‘Designshare Award’ from New York, the USA in 2003 for its aesthetic and purposeful infrastructure design and the ‘Best IT User Award”in the education category in the country’ from NASSCOM in 2004. In the year 2007, the school was rated among the five best architectural works in Delhi and NCR. In the year 2010, the school earned the honour of becoming a global member of Round Square and is also a member of the Council of International Schools (CIS).<br>

            Pathways have created a benchmark in the purposeful use of technology in school education with universal radio networking and the use of interactive whiteboards projection screens to integrate information communication technology (ICT) with classroom learning.

            Residential facilities are based on the model of a first-class British independent boarding school with professional staffing, comfortable study-bedrooms common rooms, and catering of international standards.<br>

            The school is a certified centre for SAT exams.

                        Pathways World School participated in a collaborative global project on the novel Coronavirus, organized by the Godspell College. It was a great initiative that brought together the sixteen participating schools in an extraordinary manner.

                        The aim of the conference was to create and circulate a THANK YOU NOTE seeking to provide emotional and moral support to the people who have been working on the front lines during this crisis - not only have they been serving the nation but have also shown immense courage and passion towards the world.

                        All the school representatives were introduced beforehand, each one representing a different region - coming together to represent a united world. The first meeting of the students took place on the 29th and 30th of April 2020, the aim of which was to get the children and respective adults acquainted with one another. They spoke about how they were feeling, how they were adapting to the new living situation and compared lifestyles between countries. The students had a marvellous time introducing themselves, their culture, as well as learning greetings in each other’s languages.

                        The second round of meetings took place once the thank you note was created, on 14th and 15th May 2020. During this meeting, the students from various batches presented their work - including details around whom they had written the appreciation note for, why they had chosen that person, what they were thanking them for, how they were feeling after completing this project and what impact they believed this would have. It was a great coming together of prodigious minds. Students proudly displayed their work and appreciated other’s work too. Everyone had a great time throughout the duration of the project and thoroughly enjoyed the endeavour.

                        After hosting and participating in so many MUNs, debating and deliberating over global issues, looking forward to the 3 day saga, who would have thought that we could ever have an eMUN. But here we were, 20 students from PWS, participating in different committees in an eMUN organised by Skillsphere - committees that discussed agendas revolving around the theme 'India - An Emerging Superpower'.

                        Though it was in the midst of the school summative assessments, we did not find it taxing at all, as it was just a one-day affair. Sitting formally dressed in the comfort of our homes, we connected with students from different parts of India. There were more than 200 delegates from over 40 schools from 17 cities, over two days, as the MUN was repeated on two consecutive days.

                        In the 10 committees, a maximum of only 15 participants were allowed to participate in each committee. I am so glad I was one of the participants to get this unique opportunity. The ease with which the eMUN was controlled by the chairs, lobbying was done, working papers were made, resolutions were passed, feedback was given, was simply amazing. I just did not realize how the day went by. A one day online conference taught me so much and gave me an amazing experience!!!

                        Many of the PWS participants were recognised in their committees. Winning accolades from Best Delegate in ECOSOC, to high commendations, special and verbal mentions. Most of the PWS participants were students from grades 7 & 8, with some first timers as well. Looking forward to participation in more eMUNs – a great concept!
